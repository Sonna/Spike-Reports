The Spike Plan can be used to describe the reasoning and objectives of the spike. The template describes the context of the problem and the gaps being covered. It outlines the risks being addressed as well as the goals and deliverables that the spike aims to achieve. The spike plan ends with resourcing details that list who will be undertaking the spike, the starting date and delivery date, as well as any notes on how the spike will be undertaken. These details are then used to guide the progress of the spike, and to ensure that the right points are addressed.
