# Spike

> A Spike is an agile software engineering practice used to overcome some gap 
> in knowledge or skills. In these cases it is difficult to build a plan or 
> design in which you can have much confidence. The aim of the spike is to 
> overcome these issues as quickly as possible.
> 
> When performing a Spike you build the smallest possible core solution in the 
> shortest possible time that can then be used to inform your progress using 
> that technology/domain etc. The idea of the spike is to determine how the 
> project should proceed.
> 
> The Spike Plan can be used to describe the reasoning and objectives of the 
> spike. The template describes the context of the problem and the gaps being 
> covered. It outlines the risks being addressed as well as the goals and 
> deliverables that the spike aims to achieve. The spike plan ends with 
> resourcing details that list who will be undertaking the spike, the starting 
> date and delivery date, as well as any notes on how the spike will be 
> undertaken. These details are then used to guide the progress of the spike, 
> and to ensure that the right points are addressed.
> 
> At the conclusion of the spike a Spike Outcome can be used to document the 
> results of the spike. The start of the report indicates an overview of the 
> spike's outcomes. Following the overview the goals and risks from the plan 
> are reiterated with additional information gained from performing the spike. 
> The body of the outcome report lists the tasks undertaken, the findings, and 
> any issues or risks that have not yet been addressed which may include 
> issues that were uncovered during the spike. The report concludes with 
> recommendations on how the team should proceed.
