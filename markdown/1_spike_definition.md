# Spike

> A Spike is an agile software engineering practice used to overcome some gap in knowledge or skills. In these cases it is difficult to build a plan or design in which you can have much confidence. The aim of the spike is to overcome these issues as quickly as possible.
>
> When performing a Spike you build the smallest possible core solution in the shortest possible time that can then be used to inform your progress using that technology/domain etc. The idea of the spike is to determine how the project should proceed.
